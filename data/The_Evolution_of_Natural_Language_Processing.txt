2. Basic Concepts
2.1 Basic concepts of natural language processing (NLP) models
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer
Science, aiming to understand how computers can understand, analyze, and generate natural language
like humans.
NLP includes various aspects such as natural language processing, semantic analysis, contextual
analysis, machine translation, and automatic text generation. NLP models are developed to help
computers understand and process natural language like humans.
The first NLP models were developed based on specific rules. However, rule-based models cannot solve
all cases in natural language, especially when dealing with complex and ambiguous sentences.
A new approach used to address this problem is to use data-driven models such as deep neural networks
and seq2seq machine translation models. These models use machine learning techniques to
automatically learn from data and create a representative model for natural language.
In NLP, natural language processing is performed by analyzing the syntax, semantics, and context of
text.

Picture 2.1.1.en Natural Language Processing
Syntax analysis is related to how sentences are constructed, particularly how words are arranged
together.
Semantic analysis is related to the meaning of words and sentences. This is an important aspect of
natural language processing, as it helps computers understand the meaning of a sentence in its context.
Context analysis is related to evaluating the semantic meaning of a sentence based on the surrounding
context. Understanding the context of a sentence is crucial in natural language processing, as it helps
computers distinguish different meanings of a word in different situations.
The concepts of syntax and phonetics are also important aspects of NLP. Syntax relates to the structure
of a sentence, specifically how words are arranged and combined to form a complete sentence.
Phonetics relates to the sound of language, specifically how sounds are combined to form words and
sentences.
To process natural language, researchers use various methods and techniques, including statistical
models and deep learning. Statistical models use statistical methods to analyze and model language,
while deep learning models use neural networks to learn and predict language sequences.
Common techniques in NLP include parsing, text classification, information extraction, text
summarization, machine translation, and automated content generation. NLP applications can be found
in many different fields, including consulting, healthcare, education, research, and development.

Picture 2.1.2.en NPL
In the future, NLP is expected to play an increasingly important role in solving human and societal
problems. It can be used to improve communication between humans and computers, enhance user
experiences, aid in research and development, and support decision-making processes. However, there
are still many challenges and risks that must be addressed in developing and using NLP models,
including ChatGPT. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring the privacy and security of user
information. The use of NLP models like ChatGPT can lead to the disclosure of personal information
or violate users' privacy, particularly in healthcare and finance applications. Therefore, appropriate
security solutions are needed to ensure privacy and information security.
In addition to the challenges related to privacy, security, and objectivity, NLP models also face
challenges of accuracy and complexity. While ChatGPT has achieved many successes in natural
language processing, there are still cases where the model does not provide accurate results or
understand the meaning of a sentence. Furthermore, NLP models like ChatGPT have high complexity,
requiring significant computational resources and data to train and use.
Overall, the basic concepts of natural language processing (NLP) are crucial to understanding and
developing NLP models like ChatGPT. However, the development and use of NLP models still face
many challenges and risks, requiring continuous improvement from researchers and experts in the field
of artificial intelligence.

In the future, NLP models like ChatGPT will continue to develop and expand their applications in
various fields. However, it is important to ensure that this development occurs responsibly and with
awareness of ethical and information security issues. This requires close cooperation between
researchers, experts, and government organizations and agencies to develop appropriate policies and
regulations for the use and development of NLP models.
With the continuous progress of artificial intelligence, we can hope that NLP models like ChatGPT will
continue to make important contributions to solving complex human and societal problems while
ensuring sustainable and ethical development of artificial intelligence.

With the continuous development and progress of the technology industry, the NLP models mentioned
above are just some examples of NLP models prior to the introduction of ChatGPT and at the time this
document was released.
Advanced NLP models have brought significant progress in the field of natural language processing.
One of the biggest advances is the emergence of neural network-based models such as LSTM (Long
Short-Term Memory), Transformer network, and their variations. Thanks to these models, natural
language processing tasks such as parsing, semantic analysis, text generation, machine translation, and
automatic content summarization can be performed more effectively.
Furthermore, advanced NLP models are also being used to address global issues such as decoding
natural language, supporting the creation of multilingual dictionaries, and solving other language
processing-related issues in a multilingual environment.

2.3 Concepts of Recurrent Neural Networks
The transformer, also known as a recurrent neural network, is a neural network architecture widely used
in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as machine translation, text classification, and
text summarization. This architecture was introduced in 2017 by Ashish Vaswani and colleagues from
Google Brain.
One of the advantages of the transformer is its ability to process input as a sequence and understand the
context of each word in the sequence. It uses self-attention layers to determine the importance of each
word in the input sequence. These self-attention layers allow the transformer to focus on the important
parts of a sentence to efficiently solve complex NLP tasks.
An example of an application that uses the transformer is Google Translate's machine translation.
Google Translate uses a transformer model to translate text from one language to another. The model
was trained on millions of translation pairs and is capable of handling complex sentences with high
accuracy. During the translation process, the transformer model uses self-attention layers to focus on
the important parts of the input sentence and a decoding layer to generate the corresponding output
sentence. Thanks to the transformer model, Google Translate has become one of the top online
translation tools in the world.

In addition, the transformer uses encoder and decoder layers to represent and process input and output
sequences. The encoder layer helps to represent words in the input sequence as numerical vectors, while
the decoder layer helps to generate the corresponding output sequence.
The transformer is also capable of learning to generate new output sequences without specific input.
This means that the transformer is capable of generating new natural language sentences, which are
used in applications such as automatic content creation and speech-to-text conversion.
One prominent application of the transformer is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2)
natural language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-2 is a text generation model capable of generating
high-quality, natural language text and is used in automatic content creation and book writing
applications.
However, while the transformer is a highly effective neural network architecture for NLP applications,
it also has some limitations. This includes requiring a large amount of training data and computational
resources to train the transformer model, especially for large models such as GPT-3. Training such a
model can take hundreds or even thousands of hours of computation, depending on the size of the model.
In addition, some NLP applications such as real-time natural language processing still face challenges
when using transformer models due to the high computation and data processing requirements.
Another issue is that the performance of the transformer can be reduced when facing new languages or
unclear data types. This is especially true when the model is not trained on similar data.
Despite these limitations, with the development of computing technology and natural language data,
the transformer model remains an important and promising tool for solving problems in the NLP field.
It has been widely used in applications such as machine translation, text classification, text
summarization, and automatic text generation, and is continuously being developed and improved to
meet the increasing demands of the market.

The architecture of ChatGPT
3.1 Details about the architecture of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a language model built on top of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 3.5
architecture, developed by OpenAI. The GPT architecture is designed to automatically learn and
generate natural language text using deep neural network layers and deep learning techniques.
The architecture of ChatGPT is a machine learning system capable of processing and generating
questions and answers in conversations. To do this, ChatGPT uses the Transformer architecture, a neural
network architecture introduced by Vaswani and colleagues in 2017. Transformer is a neural network
architecture that can process input as a sequence and understand the context of words in that sequence.
To do this, Transformer uses self-attention layers to determine the importance of each word in the input
sequence. These self-attention layers help the Transformer focus on important parts of the sentence to
efficiently solve complex natural language processing tasks.
In addition, ChatGPT uses pre-training techniques to train the model on a large amount of text data
before fine-tuning on specific tasks. Pre-training techniques help the model learn about natural language
knowledge automatically and objectively, thereby improving the generalization ability of the model in
solving different natural language processing tasks.

However, ChatGPT also faces some issues such as the vanishing gradient problem (the deeper into the
sentence, the harder it is for the model to understand) and the adversarial attack problem (changing a
few words can cause the model to generate incorrect results). To address these issues, researchers are
continuing to develop new models and improve training and evaluation techniques to improve the
performance and reliability of ChatGPT and other natural language models.

3.1.1 Architecture Transformer:
The Transformer architecture is built on the basis of the self-attention layer and combines the
encoder and decoder layers to represent and process the input and output sequences.
Suppose we want the computer to generate a natural language sentence from an input text. To do this,
we need a first processing step to represent the words in the sentence as numerical vectors so that the
computer can understand them.
To represent the words in a sentence as numerical vectors, the Transformer architecture uses an encoder
layer to convert the words in the sentence into corresponding numerical vectors. These vectors are then
fed into self-attention layers to determine the importance of each word in the sentence.
For example, suppose we have the sentence "I like reading books." To represent the words in this
sentence as numerical vectors, we can use the one-hot encoding method, where each word is represented
by a vector with a size equal to the number of words in the vocabulary, where only one element of the
vector is 1 (representing that word), and the rest are 0. For instance, the word "I" can be represented by
the vector [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the word "like" can be represented by the vector [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], and so on
for the other words.
After representing the words as numerical vectors, the Transformer architecture uses self-attention
layers to determine the importance of each word in the sentence. This allows the Transformer to
understand the context of the sentence and focus on the important parts to solve complex natural
language processing tasks. Then, decoder layers are used to generate the corresponding output
sequences.
In simpler terms, the Transformer architecture can understand the meaning of each word in the sentence
and identify which words are more important in that sentence. It then uses this information to generate
answers or similar texts. Therefore, the Transformer is an important tool in solving problems in the field
of natural language processing..

Specifically, the Transformer architecture uses two types of self-attention: the encoder self-attention
and the decoder self-attention. The encoder self-attention allows the words in the sentence to interact
with each other, while the decoder self-attention helps generate the output result. Each self-attention
layer is composed of three parts: the query function, the key function, and the value function.
In the query function, each word in the input sequence is transformed into a query vector. In the key
function, each word in the input sequence is transformed into a key vector. In the value function, each
word in the input sequence is transformed into a value vector. These vectors are then used to calculate
the attention scores between each word in the sequence.
The attention scores are calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector and the key vector, and
then normalizing the result using the square root of the dimensionality of the key vector. The resulting
scores are used to weight the value vectors, and the weighted sum of the value vectors is the final output
of the self-attention layer.

By using these self-attention layers, the Transformer architecture can capture the relationships between
the words in a sentence and generate high-quality outputs for natural language processing tasks.
Illustration of Self-attention:
-

The first step is to prepare the input by representing the words in the input sentence as numerical vectors. Then,
weights are initialized for the self-attention layers.
Next, in the Key, Query, and Value step, each word in the input sentence is represented by three corresponding
vectors: a Key vector, a Query vector, and a Value vector.
Then, the attention score for each word in the input sentence is calculated in the Calculate Attention Score for
Input 1 step. The attention score is calculated by multiplying the Query vector of that word with the Key vector
of all the other words in the input sentence.
The next step is to calculate the softmax of the attention scores. The softmax function is used to convert the
attention scores into probabilities.
Then, the values in the input sentence are multiplied by the corresponding attention scores to obtain Output 1.
Finally, steps 4-7 are repeated for other input sentences (Input 2 and Input 3), and the values calculated from these
steps are aggregated to form the final output.
Step 1: Initializing the Input

Picture 3.1.1.vi Prepare Input
We will start with 3 inputs as follows:
Input 1: [1, 0, 1, 0]
Input 2: [0, 2, 0, 2]
Input 3: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Step 2: Initializing the Weights
Each input must have three representations (see the diagram below). These representations are called Key (orange),
Query (red), and Value (purple). This example assumes that we want these representations to have a size of 3. Since
each input has a size of 4, each set of weights must have a shape of 4x3.

Picture 3.1.2.vi Deriving key, query and value representations from each input
To obtain these representations, each input (green) is multiplied by a set of weights for Keys (orange), a set of
weights for Queries (red), and a set of weights for Values (purple). In our example, we initialize three sets of weights
as follows.
Weights for Keys:
0 1 1
1 1 0
[
]
0 1 0
1 1 0
Weights for query:
1 0 1
1 0 0
[

0 0 1
0 1 1
Weights for value:
0 2 0
0 3 0
[
]
1 0 3
1 0 0
Note:
In neural network models, these weights are usually initialized with small values, randomly initialized with
appropriate random distributions such as Gaussian, Xavier, and Kaiming distributions. This initialization is done
once before starting the training process.
Step 3: Computing the Key, Query, and Value Representations
To obtain the key, query, and value representations for each input, we multiply each input (green) by a set of weights
for key, a set of weights for query, and a set of weights for value. In our example, we initialize three sets of weights
as follows.

Weights for Key:
Next, we use these sets of weights to compute the key, query, and value representations for each input.
Key representation for Input 1:
0 0 1
[1 0 1 0]. [ 1 1 0] = [0 0

1 1 0
Using the same set of weights to obtain the key representation for Input 3:
0 0 1
[1 1 1 1]. [ 1 1 0] = [2 3 1]
0 1 0
1 1 0
A faster method is to vectorize the operations.

Picture 3.1.4.vi Derive key representations from each input
We will use the same set of weights to compute the query representations for each input question:
1 0 1

1 0 2

[ 0 2 0 2] . [

Picture 3.1.5.vi Derive query representations from each input

Step 4: Computing Self-Attention Scores for Input 1.

Picture 3.1.6.vi Calculate attention scores for Input 1
To compute the attention scores, we start by taking the dot product of the query (in red) for Input 1 with all keys (in
orange), including itself. Since we have 3 key representations (due to 3 inputs), we obtain 3 attention scores (in light
blue).
[1 0

0 4

Note that we only use the query from Input 1. We will repeat this step for the other queries.
The operation above is called dot product attention, which is one of the scoring functions in attention mechanisms.
Other scoring functions include scaled dot product attention and additive/concatenative attention.
Step 5: Calculator softmax

Picture 3.1.7.vi Softmax the attention scores (blue)
𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥([ 2

Step 6: Multiply the Attention Scores by the Value Representations

Picture 3.1.8.vi Derive weighted value representation (yellow) from multiply value (purple) and score (blue)
The attention scores calculated for the inputs (green) are multiplied with their corresponding values (purple) to
generate aligned vectors (yellow). In this tutorial, we call them weighted values.
1: 0.0 * [1, 2, 3] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
2: 0.5 * [2, 8, 0] = [1.0, 4.0, 0.0]
3: 0.5 * [2, 6, 3] = [1.0, 3.0, 1.5]
Step 7: Summing up the weighted values to get Output 1.

Picture 3.1.9.vi Sum all weighted values (yellow) to get Output 1 (dark green)
Take all the weighted values (yellow) and sum them up element-wise:
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
+ [1.0, 4.0, 0.0]
+ [1.0, 3.0, 1.5]
----------------= [2.0, 7.0, 1.5]
The resulting vector [2.0, 7.0, 1.5] (in dark green) is Output 1, which is based on the query representation of Input 1

In order to calculate the probability of the next word in a word sequence, GPT uses a language model
with a Transformer architecture. This architecture uses self-attention layers to evaluate the
importance of words in the sequence, thereby determining the probability of the next word.

3.1.2 Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)
Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a natural language processing model developed by
OpenAI, which is the next version of the previous GPT models. GPT-3 uses the Transformer neural
network architecture to process and generate natural language text.
Pre-training technique is a method of training a model by using a large amount of data before finetuning the model on specific tasks. GPT-3 has been trained on a huge amount of text data from the
Internet, with the total number of neural network parameters reaching billions. This helps the model
automatically and generally learn knowledge about natural language, thereby enhancing the model's
generalization ability in solving various natural language processing tasks.
One of the outstanding features of GPT-3 is its ability to generate very accurate and diverse natural
language text, making the model a very useful tool for conversational applications, automatic text
generation, and other natural language processing-related applications.
However, some issues regarding reliability and data dependency have also been mentioned when
using GPT-3. Due to the large amount of training data, the model may generate biased results or may
generate inaccurate information if the training data contains biased information. Therefore, careful
testing and evaluation before using the model is very important.

Below is an example of sentence analysis using GPT-3:
Input sentence: "What is the capital of France?"
Firstly, GPT-3 will identify that this is a geography-related question. Then, it will search through its
memory and use the knowledge learned from pre-training to answer this question.
The analysis result from GPT-3: "The capital of France is Paris."
This result is accurate, consistent with the information that Paris is the capital of France. GPT-3 has
used its pre-learned knowledge to process the question and answer it accurately and naturally.

One way to model the process of natural language analysis is through mathematical formulas. These
methods are often used to determine how words or phrases in a sentence are related to each other.
One of the most common mathematical methods for natural language analysis is the Vector Space
Model (VSM). VSM is a method for representing words or phrases in a multi-dimensional vector
space so that distances between them can be computed.
For example, suppose we want to analyze the sentence "He is eating rice" using the VSM model.
First, the words in the sentence would be represented as vectors in the vector space. Then, the
distances between these vectors would be calculated to determine how the words in the sentence are
related to each other.
For example, the words "Anh ta" and "đang ăn" can be represented as two different vectors in the
vector space. Then, the distance between these two vectors will be calculated to determine the degree
of relationship between these two words in the sentence.
The VSM model can also be used to analyze and compare different texts. The words in the texts will be
represented as vectors in the high-dimensional vector space, and then the distances between these
vectors will be calculated to determine the similarity or differences between the texts.
To explain the example above using mathematical formulas, we can use some mathematical formulas
related to the VSM model.
First, we need to represent the words in the sentence "Anh ta đang ăn cơm" as vectors in the highdimensional vector space. One simple way to do this is to use the method of counting the number of
occurrences of each word in the text and represent it as a vector. For example, we can represent the
word "Anh ta" as the vector [1, 0, 0, 0], "đang" as the vector [0, 1, 0, 0], "ăn" as the vector [0, 0, 1, 0],
and "cơm" as the vector [0, 0, 0, 1].
Then, we need to calculate the distances between these vectors to determine the degree of relationship
between the words in the sentence. There are many ways to calculate the distance between two vectors
in the high-dimensional vector space, one of the most common ways is to use the cosine similarity
measure.
The cosine similarity measure is calculated by taking the dot product of two vectors and dividing it by
the product of their lengths. For example, to calculate the cosine similarity between the vector of the
word "Anh ta" and the word "đang", we will calculate:
cosine_similarity("Anh ta","đang") =

dot([1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0])
||[1,0,0,0]|| ∗ ||[0,1,0,0]||

=

0
=0
1∗1

Similarly, to calculate the cosine similarity between the vector of the word "đang" and the word "ăn",
we would calculate:
dot([0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0])
||[0,1,0,0]|| ∗ ||[0,0,1,0]||

=

0
=0
1∗1

he result shows that the two words "đang" and "ăn" are not related to each other in the sentence.

Thus, we can use these cosine similarity measures to calculate the degree of relationship between
words in the sentence and understand how they are linked together.
However, counting the number of occurrences of words and representing them as vectors is just one
way to represent natural language as vectors. Currently, there are many different methods for
representing natural language as vectors, including deep neural network models such as RNN, CNN,
and Transformer. These methods allow us to model more complex relationships between words and
phrases in the sentence, and achieve higher performance in natural language processing.
With complex natural language representation models like BERT, the generated representation
vectors contain much more information about the semantics and context of the word. When
computing cosine similarity between these vectors, we will get a result that shows the degree of
relationship between words in the sentence.
Here is some Python code to calculate the cosine similarity between the vector representations of
words in the sentence "Anh ta đang ăn cơm" using the scikit-learn library:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np
# Representing words as vectors
word_vectors = model(input_ids).last_hidden_state[0]

# Calculate consine similarity between the vectors representing the
words
8. similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(word_vectors)
9.
10. # Print cosine similarity between the words
11. print(similarity_matrix)

The cosine similarity calculation shows the level of relationship between words in the sentence "Anh
ta đang ăn cơm". In this case, the words "anh ta", "đang", and "ăn" have a higher degree of similarity
with each other than the word "cơm", because these words often appear together in Vietnamese
sentences.
Here is a Python code snippet using the OpenAI API to calculate cosine similarity between words in
the sentence "What is the capital of France?":
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

import openai
import numpy as np
# API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Calculate consine similarity between the vectors representing the
words
8. question = "What is the capital of France?"
9. tokens = question.split()
10. embeddings = openai.Completion.create(
11.
engine="text-davinci-002",
12.
prompt=f"Compute cosine similarity between the following vectors:
{tokens}",
13.
max_tokens=1024,
14.
n=1,
15.
stop=None,
16.
temperature=0.5

17. ).choices[0].text
18. similarity_matrix = np.fromstring(embeddings, sep=" ").reshape((len(t
okens), len(tokens)))
19.
20. # Print cosine similarity
21. print(similarity_matrix)

The above code uses the GPT-3 API to calculate cosine similarity between words in the sentence
"What is the capital of France?". We use the "text-davinci-002" engine to ensure we get the most
accurate and natural results. The vector representations returned by GPT-3 are processed and returned
as a string of floating-point numbers separated by spaces. We use the numpy.fromstring function to
convert this string into a matrix of cosine similarity between words in the sentence.
The calculated cosine similarity between words shows the degree of correlation between them. In this
case, the words "capital", "France", and "Paris" have a higher degree of correlation with each other
compared to other words, because these words often appear together in English sentences related to
geography.

3.1.3 Loss Prediction GPT-4
To verify the scalability of our optimized infrastructure, we predict the final loss value of GPT-4 on
our internal source code (not part of the training set) using a scaling law with an irreducible loss term
(as in Henighan et al. [15]): 𝐿(𝐶) = 𝑎𝐶 𝑏 + 𝑐, , where the models are trained using the same method
but with up to 10,000x less computation than GPT-4.
You can represent the "scaling law with an irreducible loss term" formula in LaTeX as follows:
𝐿(𝐶) = 𝑎𝐶 𝑏 + 𝑐s
Here, "L" represents the loss value of the model, "C" represents the amount of computation used for
training the model, and "a", "b", and "c" are coefficients estimated from smaller training models. The
irreducible term "c" is added to ensure the accuracy of the prediction..
Given three models A, B, and C trained with respective computations of 10, 100, and 1000, with
resulting loss values of L(A) = 2, L(B) = 5, and L(C) = 8, we can estimate the coefficients a, b, and c
using smaller training models.
Assuming we use model A to estimate the coefficients a and b, we can rewrite the formula as:
𝐿=𝑐+

𝑎
𝐶 𝑏
(10) + c

Substituting the values for model A, we have:
2=𝑐+

𝑎
(1)𝑏

+𝑐

=𝑐+𝑎

Assuming we use model B to estimate the coefficient b, we can write:
5=𝑐+

Substituting the value for model C, we have:

𝑎
𝐶 𝑏
(100) + 𝑐

8=𝑐+

𝑎
𝐶 𝑏
(1000) + 𝑐

We can solve for the coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 by using these equations simultaneously.

3.2 The characteristics and advantages of ChatGPT:
In today's digital world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way we interact with
machines and technology. One of the areas where AI has made significant strides is Natural Language

and develop, helping to solve current issues and opening up many new applications in the future.

4. Training and fine-tuning of ChatGPT
4.1 Training process of ChatGPT:
ChatGPT is a development from InstructGPT, which introduced a new method of integrating
human feedback into the training process to achieve results that align with the user's intentions.
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is described in detail in OpenAI's 2022 paper
on Training Language Models to Follow Instructions with Human Feedback and is simplified below
Step 1: Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)
The first development related to fine-tuning the GPT-3 model involved hiring 40 annotators to
create a supervised training dataset, in which the input has a known output for the model to learn from.
The inputs, or prompts, were collected from real user data into the Open API. The annotators then wrote
a response that matches the prompt, creating a known output for each input. The GPT-3 model was then
fine-tuned using this new supervised dataset, to create GPT-3.5, also known as the SFT model.
To maximize diversity in the prompt dataset, only 200 prompts could come from any one user ID and
all prompts sharing a common long prefix were removed. Finally, all prompts containing personally
identifiable information (PII) were removed.
After synthesizing prompts from the OpenAI API, the annotators were also asked to create template
prompts to fill in categories that only had few real-world example prompts. The categories of interest
include:
-

Plain prompts - simple questions: They are arbitrary requests not limited by any type.
Few-shot prompts - question-answer pairs: They are instructions containing many
query/response pairs that can be used to learn from specific examples.
User-based prompts - user-based questions: They are instructions corresponding to a
specific use case requested for the OpenAI API.

When creating responses, employees are asked to try to infer what the user's prompt is asking for. The
article describes three main ways in which prompts request information.
-

Direct: "Tell me about..."

-

Few-shot: Give two examples of a story, write a different story on a similar topic.
Continuation: Given the beginning of a story, complete it.

Synthesizing prompts from the OpenAI API and written by employees led to 13,000 input/output
examples to use for the supervised model.

human feedback OpenAI et al., 2022 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf. Additional context added in
red (right) by the author.
Step 2: Reward Model
After the SFT model is trained in step 1, the model will generate more compatible responses to user
requests. The next improvement step is to train a reward model in which the input of the model is a
sequence of requests and responses, and the output is a scalar value called reward. The reward model is
required to use Reinforcement Learning where a model learns to generate outputs to maximize its
reward (see step 3).
To train the reward model, evaluators are presented with 4 to 9 outputs of the SFT model for a single
input request. They are asked to rank these outputs from best to worst, creating the following output
ranking combinations.

Picture 3.1.12.en Example of response ranking combinations
The inclusion of each ranking combination in the model as a separate data point leads to overfitting
(cannot be applied to new data). To address this issue, the model is built based on each ranking group
as a single data point.

human feedback OpenAI et al., 2022 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf. Additional context added in
red (right) by the author.
Step 3: Reinforcement Learning Model
In the final stage, the model is presented with a random prompt and returns a response. The response is
generated using the 'policy' that the model learned in step 2. The policy represents a strategy that the
machine has learned to achieve its goal, which in this case is to maximize its reward. Based on the
reward model developed in step 2, a reward value is determined for each prompt-response pair. The
reward is then fed back into the model to evolve the policy.
In 2017, Schulman et al. introduced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a method used to update the
model's policy each time a response is generated. PPO incorporates a Kullback–Leibler (KL) per-token
penalty from the SFT model. KL divergence measures the similarity between two probability
distributions and penalizes large divergences. In this case, using a KL penalty reduces the distance that
responses can deviate from the output of the SFT model trained in step 1 to avoid over-optimizing the
reward model and deviating too much from human-intended dataset.

human feedback OpenAI et al., 2022 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf. Additional context added in
red (right) by the author.
Steps 2 and 3 of the process can be repeated multiple times in practice, although this has not been
done much.
4.2 Fine-tuning ChatGPT for specific applications:
Fine-tuning ChatGPT is an important process to achieve the best performance of the model on
different tasks and languages. In this section, we will look at how to fine-tune ChatGPT for specific
applications such as text classification, machine translation, and text generation.
4.2.1 Fine-tuning ChatGPT cho phân loại văn bản
Text classification is an important task in natural language processing. Fine-tuning ChatGPT for text
classification can be done by using labeled datasets to adjust the model to classify texts into different
classes.
Specifically, to fine-tune ChatGPT for text classification, we can use a labeled dataset and use transfer
learning:
1. from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2ForSequenceClassification
, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArgu
ments
2.
3. tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
4. model = GPT2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("gpt2", num_lab
els=2)
5.
6. train_path = "train.txt"
7. train_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=train_path
, block_size=128)
8.
9. training_args = TrainingArguments(
10.
output_dir='./results',

args=training_args,
21.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
22.
prediction_loss_only=True
23. )
24.
25. trainer.train()

In this example, we use the labeled dataset train.txt to fine-tune the ChatGPT model for text
classification. This dataset may contain labeled texts and is divided into different classes. We use
parameters and techniques such as num_train_epochs and per_device_train_batch_size to adjust the
training process.
4.2.2 Fine-tuning ChatGPT for Machine Translation

Fine-tuning ChatGPT for machine translation is another application of the model. To fine-tune
ChatGPT for machine translation, we can use a bilingual dataset and use transfer learning to adjust the
model to generate accurate translations.
Specifically, to fine-tune ChatGPT for machine translation, we can use a bilingual dataset to adjust the
model. In this approach, we use the model that has been pre-trained on a large amount of English data,
and then fine-tune the model to generate accurate translations on a new dataset.
Here is an example of fine-tuning ChatGPT for machine translation using the Hugging Face
Transformers library:
1. from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, TextDataset,
DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments
2.
3. tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
4. model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
5.
6. train_path = "parallel_corpus.txt"
7. train_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=train_path
, block_size=128)
8.
9. data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer,
mlm=False)
10.
11. training_args = TrainingArguments(
12.
output_dir='./results',
13.
overwrite_output_dir=True,
14.
num_train_epochs=3,
15.
per_device_train_batch_size=16,
16.
save_steps=1000,
17.
save_total_limit=2
18. )
19.
20. trainer = Trainer(
21.
model=model,
22.

23.
data_collator=data_collator,
24.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
25.
prediction_loss_only=True
26. )
27.
28. trainer.train()

In this example, we use a text dataset to fine-tune the ChatGPT model for text generation. We can use
parameters and tuning techniques such as num_train_epochs and per_device_train_batch_size to
adjust the training process.
4.2.3 Fine-tuning ChatGPT for text generation
Fine-tuning ChatGPT for text generation is another application of the model. To fine-tune
ChatGPT for text generation, we can use a text dataset and use transfer learning to adjust the model to
generate accurate texts.
Specifically, to fine-tune ChatGPT for text generation, we can use a text dataset to adjust the model. In
this method, we use a model that has been pre-trained on a large amount of English data, then fine-tune
the model to generate accurate texts on new dataset.

Here is an example of fine-tuning ChatGPT for text generation using the Transformers library from
Hugging Face:
1. from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, TextDataset, DataCol
latorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments
2.
3. tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
4. model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
5.
6. train_path = "text_corpus.txt"
7. train_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=train_path, block_
size=128)
8.
9. data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=Fals
e)
10.
11. training_args = TrainingArguments(
12.
output_dir='./results',
13.
overwrite_output_dir=True,

24.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
25.
prediction_loss_only=True
26. )
27.
28. trainer.train()

In this example, we use the text_corpus.txt dataset to fine-tune the ChatGPT model for text
generation. This dataset contains unlabeled texts. We use parameters and techniques such as
num_train_epochs and per_device_train_batch_size to adjust the training process.
However, to achieve the best performance of the model on various tasks and languages, we
need to use appropriate datasets and fine-tuning methods for each specific task. The pre-training and
fine-tuning process is an effective method to improve the performance of the ChatGPT model on new
languages and tasks

4.3 Training and Fine-tuning Techniques:
In machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), training and fine-tuning models
are essential for achieving the best performance in NLP tasks such as text classification, machine
translation, sentiment analysis, and more. In this article, we will delve into training and fine-tuning
techniques, including the use of different datasets, model architectures, optimization algorithms, and
tuning techniques.
4.3.1 Training the Model
4.3.1.1 Dataset
A good dataset is an important factor in achieving good results in model training. The datasets
used for training and fine-tuning the model can be pre-existing or created by collecting data. Some
popular datasets used in NLP include the Reuters dataset, the IMDB dataset, and the WikiText dataset.
Here is an example of the Reuters dataset, a commonly used dataset in NLP:

The Reuters dataset is a collection of news documents used to train and test text classification
models. The dataset contains over 20,000 documents, divided into two subsets: a training subset
and a testing subset. Each document is a news item classified into one of 90 different topics.
The Reuters dataset has been used to train and test text classification models, including topic
prediction models and sentiment prediction models. This dataset has been used in many NLP
competitions and studies.
We can download the Reuters dataset from the scikit-learn library in Python using the following
code:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_rcv1
rcv1 = fetch_rcv1()
X_train = rcv1.data[:23149]
y_train = rcv1.target[:23149].toarray()
X_test = rcv1.data[23149:]
y_test = rcv1.target[23149:].toarray()

In which rcv1 is an object containing the Reuters dataset, X_train and y_train are the
training set, and X_test and y_test are the test set. We can use these sets to train and test text
classification models.
WikiText dataset:
The WikiText dataset is a collection of text documents taken from Wikipedia and used to train
and test natural language processing models. This dataset includes three subsets: WikiText-2,
WikiText-103, and WikiText-103-sentences.
WikiText-2 is a smaller dataset with about 2 million words and is used to train simple text
models. WikiText-103 is a larger dataset with about 103 million words and is used to train
deeper natural language models. WikiText-103-sentences is a version of WikiText-103 with
text passages divided into individual sentences.
The WikiText dataset has been widely used in training and testing natural language processing
models, including models predicting the next word, text generation models, and machine
translation models. It has become one of the most popular datasets in the field of NLP.
We can download the WikiText dataset from the PyTorch library in Python using the following
code:
1. import torchtext
2.
3. train, valid, test = torchtext.datasets.WikiText2.splits()
4. train_iter, valid_iter, test_iter = torchtext.data.BPTTIterator.splits(
5.
(train, valid, test), batch_size=32, bptt_len=30, device='cuda')

In this example, the train, valid, and test sets are respectively the training set, validation set,
and test set. train_iter, valid_iter, and test_iter are objects used to iterate through the data
sets on the GPU memory. We can use these data sets to train and test natural language
processing models.
4.3.1.2 Model architecture
Model architecture is another important factor in training and fine-tuning models. An
appropriate model architecture will allow the model to learn important features of the data and achieve

better results. Popular model architectures in NLP include simple neural networks, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and transformer
networks.
An example of a model architecture in NLP is the Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al.
(2017). This model uses a multi-layer architecture to automatically learn complex features of language
data and allows for good results on many different NLP tasks.
The Transformer model uses an encoder-decoder architecture to process string data, where each word
is represented by a vector. This architecture uses self-attention neural network layers to learn
relationships between words in a sentence and improve classification and text generation capabilities.
The Transformer model has many variants, with the most popular being the Generative Pre-training
Transformer (GPT) model, which is trained on large datasets to automatically learn natural language
features. The GPT model has achieved impressive results on many NLP tasks, including text generation,
machine translation, and text classification.
To use the Transformer model in NLP, we can use the Hugging Face transformers library. This library
provides many popular model architectures, including the Transformer.
The following example shows how to use the Transformer model to classify text in Python:
1. from transformers import pipeline
2.
3. # Load pre-trained Transformer model
4. classifier = pipeline('text-classification', model='distilbert-base-uncasedfinetuned-sst-2-english')
5.
6. # Classify text
7. result = classifier('This movie is really good')
8. print(result)

In the above code snippet, we use a pre-trained Transformer model on the SST-2 dataset to
classify text. First, we load the pre-trained model using the pipeline function from the
transformers library. Then, we use the loaded model to classify a sentence "This movie is really
good" by calling the classifier function with the input sentence. The result will return a
dictionary with the corresponding labels and scores for each label, indicating that the text is
classified into the positive class with a high score.
Using a pre-trained Transformer model speeds up and facilitates the development of NLP
applications and improves the performance of the model on various NLP tasks.

4.3.1.3 Loss function
The optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the model. A suitable optimization
algorithm will help the model converge faster and achieve better results. Some popular optimization
algorithms in NLP include Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and
Adagrad.
For a model with a loss function 𝐿(𝜃). where 𝜃 is the set of parameters to be optimized, the optimization
algorithm updates the value of 𝜃 so that the value 𝐿(𝜃) reaches the minimum value.
Gradient Descent: This is the simplest method to optimize a loss function. This algorithm updates the
parameters 𝜃 by using the derivative of the loss function 𝐿(𝜃) with respect to each parameter 𝜃𝑗 :

∂𝐿(𝜃)
∂𝜃𝑗
Where, 𝛼 is the learning rate, which is chosen to ensure that the algorithm converges quickly and does
not exceed the optimization limit.
𝜃𝑗 = 𝜃𝑗 − 𝛼

An example of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm:
Suppose we have a function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 We want to find the value of x for which the
function reaches the minimum value. We can use the Gradient Descent algorithm to optimize
this function.
First, we need to calculate the derivative of the function f(x):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

import sympy as sym
x = sym.symbols('x')
f = x**2 - 2*x + 1
df = sym.diff(f, x)
print("derivative f(x):", df)

Resulf: Derivative f(x) là: 2*x – 2
Next, we choose an initial value for x and set the parameters for the Gradient Descent
algorithm, including the learning rate, number of iterations, and tolerance.
1.
2.
3.
4.

x0 = 4 # Value x
lr = 0.1 # learning rate
num_iter = 100
epsilon = 1e-6

Then, we repeat the process of computing a new value for x using the formula: x_new = x_old
- learning_rate * derivative of the function at x_old. We repeat this process until the value of
the derivative is close to 0 or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
1. for i in range(num_iter):
2.
x_new = x0 - lr * df.subs(x, x0)
3.
if abs(x_new - x0) < epsilon:
4.
break
5.
x0 = x_new
6.
7. print("Giá trị của x tối ưu là:", x_new)
8. print("Giá trị nhỏ nhất của hàm số f(x) là:", f.subs(x, x_new))

The optimal value of x is: 1.00000001138681
The minimum value of the function f(x) is: 0.999999988613180
So we have found the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) to be x = 1 and the minimum
value of the function is 1.

4.3.1.4 Model Fine-tuning
After training a model, fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the model parameters to achieve better
performance on a test dataset or new data. Popular model fine-tuning techniques include:

Cross-validation: This method helps to evaluate the model on different datasets and provides better
overall results. Common cross-validation techniques include K-fold cross-validation and Leave-oneout cross-validation.
An example of cross-validation is as follows:
Suppose you want to train a machine learning model to predict house prices based on
attributes such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and age of the house. You have a
dataset of 1000 samples with 800 samples for training and 200 samples for testing.
To use cross-validation, you can divide the training data into 5 subsets (or folds) with each
subset containing 160 samples. Then, you will train the model on 4 folds and use the 5th fold
to test the model. Next, you will repeat this process with different data divisions and calculate
the average results to evaluate the model.
The evaluation results will tell you the accuracy of the model on new data and help you
choose the best model to use for predicting house prices on new data.
To perform cross-validation in Python, we can use the scikit-learn module. The example
below illustrates how to perform cross-validation to evaluate the Linear Regression model on
the Boston House Prices dataset.

from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
# Load Boston House Prices
boston = load_boston()
# Create Linear Regression
model = LinearRegression()
# Excute cross-validation with 5 fold
scores = cross_val_score(model, boston.data, boston.target, cv=5)
# Print cross-validation
print("Cross-validation scores: ", scores)
# Average cross-validation
print("Average cross-validation score: ", scores.mean())

In the code above, we use the cross_val_score function to perform 5-fold cross-validation on
the Linear Regression model. The input of the cross_val_score function includes the model,
dataset and target, and the number of folds specified by the cv parameter. The cross_val_score
function will return the cross-validation results of each fold.
After performing cross-validation, we print the results of each fold and calculate the average
results using the mean() function.
We can use the cross-validation results to evaluate the model performance and choose the best
model to use for predicting on new data.
Early stopping: This is a technique used to stop training the model before it becomes overfit to the data.
This method evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset after each epoch and stops training
if the performance does not improve.

To perform early stopping in Python, we can use the EarlyStopping callback in the keras module. The
example below illustrates how to perform early stopping during the training process of a Neural
Network model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
# Load Fashion MNIST
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0
# Create Neural Network
model = keras.Sequential([
keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
# Compile Model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
metrics=['accuracy'])
# Using early stopping detect overfitting
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, verbose=1)
# Training model with early stopping
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2, callba
cks=[early_stopping])

30.
31. # Test Accuracy
32. test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
33. print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

In the above code, we use the EarlyStopping callback to prevent overfitting during the training
process of the Neural Network model on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The monitor parameter
of the callback is used to track the loss on the validation set. If the loss on the validation set
does not decrease for patience consecutive training epochs, the training process will be
stopped. The verbose parameter is used to print a message when the early stopping process is
triggered.
After training the model with early stopping, we evaluate the model on the test set and print the
accuracy on the test set using the evaluate() function. If the accuracy on the test set is high,
then the model can be used to make predictions on new data.
The early stopping technique is an effective way to prevent overfitting during the training
process of machine learning models. It helps optimize the training process and ensures that the
model is applied to new data with higher accuracy.
Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting in a model by adding
constraints to the model's parameters. Popular regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2
regularization, and Dropout.
There are two common regularization types in machine learning: L1 regularization and L2 regularizatio.

-

L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regularization) is a method of adding a penalty term
of the absolute value of the weights to the cost function. L1 regularization can help reduce
the number of unnecessary weights and help the model find more important features in the
data.

-

L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regularization) is a method of adding a penalty term
of the square of the weights to the cost function. L2 regularization can help reduce
overfitting by making the weights of the model smaller, but not to zero like L1
regularization.

To implement regularization in Python, we can use the scikit-learn module. Below is an example of
how to perform L2 regularization (Ridge regression) on the Boston House Prices dataset.

model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
# Model Fit
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean squared error: ", mse)

In the above code, we use the Ridge class to create a Ridge Regression model with the level of
regularization adjusted by the alpha parameter. Then, we train the model on the training set
and evaluate the results on the test set using the mean_squared_error() function.
If the evaluation results on the test set are good, then the model can be used to predict on new
data. If the evaluation results are not good, we can try different values of the alpha parameter
or use the cross-validation technique to find the best model.
Regularization technique is an effective way to reduce overfitting in the model training process.
It helps improve the predictive ability of the model on new data and is one of the fundamental
techniques in machine learning.
Hyperparameter tuning: The parameters of the model are called hyperparameters and they can affect
the performance of the model. Tuning hyperparameters is an important technique to achieve the best
performance of the model. Common hyperparameter tuning techniques include Grid search, Random
search, and Bayesian optimization.
Finding the optimal values of hyperparameters is an important task in machine learning to improve the
predictive performance of the model on new data. Typically, we will use techniques like Grid Search
and Random Search to perform hyperparameter tuning.

Grid Search: This method searches for the values of hyperparameters on a pre-defined grid of values.
The values of hyperparameters are pre-selected and the model is trained with each set of
hyperparameters. The best result is selected.
Random Search: This method searches for random values of hyperparameters within a given range of
values. The values are randomly selected and the model is trained with each set of hyperparameters.
The best result is selected.
To perform hyperparameter tuning in Python, we can use the scikit-learn module. Below is an example
of how to perform Grid Search to find the optimal values of hyperparameters in a Decision Tree model
on the Iris dataset.

# Execute Grid Search

grid_search.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
# Print
print("Best parameters: ", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best score: ", grid_search.best_score_)

In the above code, we use the GridSearchCV class to perform Grid Search to find the optimal
values of hyperparameters max_depth and min_samples_split in the Decision Tree model on
the Iris dataset. The values of hyperparameters are set by the param_grid parameter, and the
number of cross-validation folds is set by the cv parameter. The result of finding the optimal
values of hyperparameters is printed using the best_params_ and best_score_ functions.
If the result of finding the optimal values of hyperparameters is good, we can use this value to
train the model on the entire dataset and evaluate the performance on the test set. If the result
is not good, we can try other values of hyperparameters or use the Random Search technique
to find other optimal values.
Hyperparameter tuning is an important task in machine learning to improve the predictive
performance of the model on new data. We can use techniques such as Grid Search and Random
Search to perform hyperparameter tuning and find the optimal values of hyperparameters in
the model.

4.3.2 Model fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is the process of using a pre-trained model to solve a new task or improve the
model's performance on a similar task. Common fine-tuning techniques include:
Fine-tuning the last layer: This is the simplest method for fine-tuning a pre-trained model.
Instead of retraining the entire model, we only need to retrain the last layer of the model to fit

the new task. For example, we can use a pre-trained model to classify images with multiple
classes and fine-tune only the last layer to classify images with a different set of classes.
Fine-tuning the entire model: This method is usually used when the new task requires different
training data than the original task. In this method, we retrain the entire model with new data
to optimize the model's weights for the new task.
Transfer learning: This is the method of using a pre-trained model for a new task. We use the
weights of the pre-trained model to initialize a new model and continue training the new model
with new data. This method is often used when the new task is related to the original task. For
example, we can use a pre-trained model to classify dogs and cats and use it for object detection
tasks.
Multi-task learning: This is the method of using a single model to solve multiple different tasks
simultaneously. We train the model with multiple datasets and allow it to learn how to solve
multiple different tasks. This method is often used when the tasks are related or can support
each other.
Pre-training: Pre-training is the process of training a model on a subtask before fine-tuning the
model on the main task. This method helps improve the model's performance and reduces
training time.
Domain adaptation: Domain adaptation is the process of adjusting the model to achieve better
performance on a new dataset with different characteristics than the original training dataset.
Common domain adaptation techniques include Adversarial Training and Multi-task Learning.
Data augmentation: Data augmentation is the technique of creating new data samples from the
original training data to improve the model's performance. Common data augmentation
techniques include Augmented Text Generation and Back-translation.
To fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model, you can follow these steps:
Prepare the data: Build a suitable dataset for the fine-tuning task. This dataset should contain
examples with complete information and represent the input data in real-life scenarios.
Additionally, the dataset needs to be prepared in standard text format and divided into train,
validation, and test sets.
Create the model: Use GPT-3.5 to create a pre-trained model. You can use pre-built versions
of the model on platforms such as Hugging Face or OpenAI.
Pre-train the model: Pre-train the model on a large and diverse dataset to increase the model's
transfer learning capabilities.
Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the model's weights using the dataset
prepared in step 1. You need to define the loss function and use optimization algorithms to
minimize this loss function. Fine-tuning can continue until the best result is achieved on the
validation set or a limited number of fine-tuning attempts.
Evaluation and save the model: Evaluate the model on the test set to check its performance on
new data. Then, save the model to use for related fine-tuning tasks.

Note that fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model is a resource- and time-intensive process, so you need to have
sufficient resources to perform this process. Additionally, achieving good results when fine-tuning the
model depends on many factors such as data quality, data preparation, loss function definition,
optimization algorithm, number of fine-tuning attempts, etc.
Here is a specific example of how to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model using Python:
1. from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead, TextDataset, Dat
aCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments
2.
3. # tokenizer
4. tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt3-medium')
5.
6. train_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path='train.txt', block
_size=128)
7. valid_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path='valid.txt', block
_size=128)
8. data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=Fals
e)
9.
10. model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained('gpt3-medium')
11.
12. training_args = TrainingArguments(
13.
output_dir='./results',
14.
evaluation_strategy='steps',
15.
eval_steps=500,
16.
save_steps=500,
17.
learning_rate=5e-5,
18.
num_train_epochs=1,
19.
per_device_train_batch_size=1,
20.
per_device_eval_batch_size=1,
21.
gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
22.
weight_decay=0.01,
23.
logging_dir='./logs',
24.
logging_steps=500,
25. )
26.
27. trainer = Trainer(
28.
model=model,
29.
args=training_args,
30.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
31.
data_collator=data_collator,
32.
eval_dataset=valid_dataset,
33. )
34. trainer.train()
35.
36. trainer.evaluate()
37. trainer.save_model('fine-tuned-gpt3-medium')

Here, first we import the necessary libraries: AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead,
TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, and TrainingArguments from the
transformers library.
Next, we create a tokenizer using AutoTokenizer with the model type of gpt3-medium.
Then, we prepare the data for the fine-tuning process using TextDataset and
DataCollatorForLanguageModeling to create the training dataset and validation dataset.
Next, we create the model using AutoModelWithLMHead with the model type of gpt3-medium.
Then, we define the parameters for the fine-tuning process using TrainingArguments.

After that, we proceed with fine-tuning the model using Trainer and calling the train() function.
Finally, we evaluate the model using the evaluate() function and save it.
For example, if you want to predict a value for a new value in a weather forecasting model, you can
prepare the input for the model as a question about the weather forecast and use the model to generate
an answer. For example, the question could be "What is the weather forecast for tomorrow in Hanoi?"
and the model will generate an answer like "The forecast indicates that tomorrow in Hanoi will be
cloudy and may have rain in the evening. The highest expected temperature is 28 degrees Celsius and
the lowest is 22 degrees Celsius". Then, you can process that answer to get the predicted value for the
new value, such as the highest or lowest temperature for tomorrow in Hanoi.

lowest_temp = None
for sentence in answer.split('.'):
if 'Nhiệt độ cao nhất' in sentence:
highest_temp = int(sentence.split('dự kiến là')[1].split('độ C')[0])

25.
elif 'Nhiệt độ thấp nhất' in sentence:
26.
lowest_temp = int(sentence.split('dự kiến là')[1].split('độ C')[0])
27.
28. print("Dự đoán nhiệt độ cao nhất cho ngày mai ở Hà Nội:", highest_temp)
29. print("Dự đoán nhiệt độ thấp nhất cho ngày mai ở Hà Nội:", lowest_temp)

Here, we use openai.Completion.create() to create a request for the GPT-3 model. In which,
engine is the type of model used (here is davinci), prompt is the input for the model, max_tokens
is the maximum number of generated words, n is the number of paragraphs generated, stop is
the stopping point to stop the text generation process, temperature is the degree of
independence of the text generation process.
Then, we retrieve the generated answer from the response using choices[0].text.strip(). Finally,
we process that answer to obtain the predicted values for the new values, in this case the
maximum and minimum temperatures for tomorrow in Hanoi.
Fine-tuning methods for models are commonly used in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to

Here, we use the transformers library to fine-tune a BERT model. For the whole-model finetuning method, we retrain the entire model with new data. In the last-layer fine-tuning method,
we only train the last classification layer of the model to fit the new task.
Firstly, we load the pre-trained model using the from_pretrained() method of the
AutoModelForSequenceClassification class in the transformers library. Then, we load the
corresponding tokenizer using the from_pretrained() method of the AutoTokenizer class.
Next, we prepare the data for the fine-tuning process by using the TextDataset class to create
the training and validation datasets. We also use the DataCollatorForLanguageModeling class
to prepare the data for the training process.
Then, we define the parameters for the fine-tuning process using the TrainingArguments class.
Finally, we use the Trainer class and call the train() method to train the model. For the wholemodel fine-tuning method, we use the loaded entire model, while for the last-layer fine-tuning
method, we only retrain the last classification layer of the model.

This is an example of the fine-tuning methods and how they are used with the transformers
library in Python.
Here is an example of the last-layer fine-tuning method using the transformers library in Python. We
can write it as a script file as follows:
1. from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, T
extDataset, DataCollatorWithPadding
2. from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
3.
4. train_texts = [
5.
"This product is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.",
6.
"I am very happy with this product. It works as expected.",
7.
"This product is just okay. It's nothing special.",
8.
"I don't really like this product. It doesn't work well.",
9.
"This product is terrible. I would never buy it again.",
10. ]
11. train_labels = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
12.
13. tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")
14.
15. train_encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
16. train_dataset = TextDataset(train_encodings, train_labels)
17. data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)
18.
19. model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-basecased", num_labels=2)
20.
21. training_args = TrainingArguments(
22.
output_dir="./results",
23.
num_train_epochs=1,
24.
per_device_train_batch_size=32,
25.
per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
26.
warmup_steps=500,
27.
weight_decay=0.01,
28.
logging_dir="./logs",
29.
logging_steps=10,
30.
evaluation_strategy="steps",
31.
eval_steps=50,
32. )
33.
34. trainer = Trainer(
35.
model=model,
36.
args=training_args,
37.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
38.
data_collator=data_collator,
39.
compute_metrics=lambda pred: {"accuracy": (pred.predictions.argmax(axis=1
) == pred.label_ids).mean()},
40. )
41.
42. trainer.train()
43.
44. new_comments = [
45.
"This product is really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone.",
46.
"I am not satisfied with this product. It does not work as expected.",
47.
"This product is okay. It works fine, but nothing special.",
48.
"I really like this product. It exceeded my expectations.",
49.
"This is the best product I have ever used. I highly recommend it.",
50. ]
51.
52. new_comment_encodings = tokenizer(new_comments, truncation=True, padding=True
)
53.
54. predictions = trainer.predict(new_comment_encodings)

55. predicted_labels = predictions.predictions.argmax(axis=-1)
56.
57. print(predicted_labels)

In this file, we used classes and methods in the transformers library to fine-tune a BERT
model for classifying comments into two classes: positive and negative. After training, we
used the model to predict the class of new comments and printed the results.
4.3.3. Conclusion
In the field of machine learning and NLP, training and fine-tuning models are two important
processes to achieve the best performance on NLP tasks. Using appropriate datasets, model
architectures, optimization algorithms, and tuning techniques are important factors to achieve the best
performance in model training. Fine-tuning the model is also an important technique to improve the
performance of the model on different tasks or new datasets. Using appropriate training and fine-tuning
techniques will help NLP applications achieve the best performance.
In ChatGPT, one of the popular training and fine-tuning techniques is to use pre-training and fine-tuning
the model. ChatGPT is a natural language model based on the transformer architecture, trained on a
large amount of English data. However, the ChatGPT model may still not be perfect in processing other
languages or new tasks. Therefore, to improve the model's performance on other languages or new
tasks, we can use fine-tuning techniques.
For example, if we want to use the ChatGPT model to generate questions and answers in Vietnamese,
we can use the pre-training of the ChatGPT model on a large amount of Vietnamese data, then use finetuning techniques to adjust the model to achieve better performance on the task of generating questions
and answers in Vietnamese.
Specifically, the process of pre-training the model on Vietnamese may include collecting Vietnamese
data from various sources, using data preprocessing tools to prepare the data for training, and using
transformer pre-training on Vietnamese data.
Then, we can use fine-tuning techniques to adjust the pre-trained model to achieve better performance
on the task of generating questions and answers in Vietnamese. The fine-tuning process may include
dividing the data into training and validation sets, using optimization algorithms such as SGD or Adam
to adjust the model's parameters, and using model tuning techniques such as Early stopping and
Regularization to improve the model's performance.
With such training and fine-tuning techniques, the ChatGPT model can be customized to meet specific
requirements of different NLP applications in different languages.
To illustrate the example of pre-training and fine-tuning in ChatGPT using Python, we can use the
Transformers library from Hugging Face. This library provides famous transformer models such as
BERT, GPT, and ChatGPT, as well as tools for training and tuning models.
To pre-train the ChatGPT model on Vietnamese, we can use the VNTQCorpus dataset. Below is the
Python code illustrating the pre-training process of the model::
1. from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, TextDataset,
DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments
2.
3. tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
4.
5. train_path = "vntq_corpus.txt"
6. train_dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=train_path
, block_size=128)

7.
8. data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer,
mlm=False)
9.
10. model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
11. model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))
12.
13. training_args = TrainingArguments(
14.
output_dir='./results',
15.
overwrite_output_dir=True,
16.
num_train_epochs=10,
17.
per_device_train_batch_size=16,
18.
save_steps=1000,
19.
save_total_limit=2
20. )
21.
22. trainer = Trainer(
23.
model=model,
24.
args=training_args,
25.
data_collator=data_collator,
26.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
27.
prediction_loss_only=True
28. )
29.
30. trainer.train()

After pre-training the model on Vietnamese, we can fine-tune the model to achieve better
performance on the task of creating and answering questions in Vietnamese. Below is a Python code
example for the fine-tuning process of the model:

1. from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, LineByLineTe
xtDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArgument
s
2.
3. tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
4.
5. train_path = "qa_corpus.txt"
6. train_dataset = LineByLineTextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path=
train_path, block_size=128)
7.
8. data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer,
mlm=False)
9.
10. model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
11. model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))
12.
13. training_args = TrainingArguments(
14.
output_dir='./results',
15.
overwrite_output_dir=True,
16.
num_train_epochs=3,
17.
per_device_train_batch_size=16,
18.
save_steps=1000,
19.
save_total_limit=2
20. )
21.
22. trainer = Trainer(
23.
model=model,

24.
args=training_args,
25.
data_collator=data_collator,
26.
train_dataset=train_dataset,
27.
prediction_loss_only=True
28. )
29.
30. trainer.train()

In this example, we use the qa_corpus.txt dataset to fine-tune the model to generate questions and
answers in Vietnamese. The fine-tuning process uses parameters and model tuning techniques such as
num_train_epochs and per_device_train_batch_size to adjust the training process. Additionally, we also
use tools from the Transformers library to generate appropriate training data and evaluate the
performance of the model after fine-tuning.
This example is a basic illustration of the pre-training and fine-tuning process of ChatGPT model on
Vietnamese language using Python and Transformers library. Depending on the specific task and
training dataset, the parameters and techniques for model tuning may vary to achieve the best
performance of the model. However, the pre-training and fine-tuning process is an effective method to
improve the performance of the ChatGPT model on different languages or new tasks.

5. Applications of ChatGPT
5.1 ChatGPT in the field of advice and customer support:
5.1.1 Automated customer support through chatbots
ChatGPT can be used to build customer support chatbots, helping to reduce the workload on
advisory staff. With the ability to understand natural language and provide accurate answers,
ChatGPT helps chatbots quickly and efficiently answer common customer questions.
For example: A bank can deploy a chatbot using ChatGPT to answer questions about account balances,
transfer procedures, or banking products and services.
To create sample data files, we can use information such as account number, user name,
current balance, transaction history, and update time. We can create hypothetical records as follows:
Account Number
1001
1002
….

Username
John
Nick
….

Balance
1000$
1500$
….

After obtaining the sample data file, we can apply it to build a chatbot using GPT-3.5.
Specifically, we can use Python libraries such as OpenAI API or Hugging Face Transformers
to create a chatbot based on the pre-trained GPT-3.5 model.

import openai
import pandas as pd
Khởi tạo API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
def generate_question(account_id):
return f"What is the current account balance for account {account_id}?"
account_df = pd.DataFrame({
'account_id': [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004],
'balance': [1000, 1500, 1000, 7500]

13. })
14.
15. questions = [generate_question(account_id) for account_id in account_df['acco
unt_id']]
16.
17.
18. answers = openai.Completion.create(
19. engine="text-davinci-002",
20. prompt=questions,
21. max_tokens=1024,
22. n=len(questions),
23. stop=None,
24. temperature=0.5
25. )
26.
27. answer_df = pd.DataFrame([answer.choices[0].text.strip() for answer in answer
s], columns=['answer'])
28.
29. result_df = pd.concat([account_df, answer_df], axis=1)
30.
31. print(result_df)

Here, we use the OpenAI API to generate a list of answers for account balance questions. We
first define the generate_question function to create a question based on the account
information, then use pandas to create a dataframe containing the account information. Next,
we generate a list of questions based on the account information and use the OpenAI API to
generate a list of answers. Finally, we combine the dataframe containing the account
information with the dataframe containing the answers to create the final result.
5.1.2 Product and Service Consultancy
ChatGPT is capable of providing detailed information about products and services, helping
customers make smarter shopping decisions. Based on information about customers' needs and
preferences, ChatGPT can suggest suitable products.
For example, an electronics company can use ChatGPT to advise customers on choosing the
right phone model, laptop or home appliance to suit their needs and budget.
To implement a consultancy chatbot for customers, the electronics company can use ChatGPT
to build an NLP model that allows the chatbot to understand and answer customers' questions
about electronic products.
For example, the company can use data on electronic products, including product descriptions,
specifications, prices, and customer reviews. Then, use ChatGPT to create a chatbot capable
of advising customers on products based on this information..
An example of questions that customers may ask and chatbot may answer:
Customer: "I want to buy a new phone, which model should I choose?"
Chatbot: "Do you have any preferences for operating system, storage capacity, or
screen size? Based on your budget, I suggest you consider Samsung Galaxy A51,
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro or Realme 7 Pro."
Customer: "I need a laptop for office work, around 20 million VND."

Chatbot: "Dell Inspiron 15 5593 or Asus Vivobook S15 S533FA are good options
within your budget. Do you have any requirements for performance or storage
capacity?"
To build a chatbot that supports customers in choosing products, we need a dataset of
the company's products, including detailed information about features, prices,
customer ratings, and equivalent products from other brands in the market.
For example, we can create a simple dataset with the following information:
Product name
Brand
Product description
Main features
Price
Customer ratings
Equivalent products from other brands in the market
Then, we can use OpenAI to generate questions and answers for the chatbot based on
this information. For example, we can use the openai.Completion.create() function to
generate questions from customers and use the GPT-3.5 model to answer these
questions.
Below is an example of how to use Python and OpenAI to build a product advisory
chatbot:

# Create dataframe containing product information
product_df = pd.DataFrame({
'name': ['Smartphone A', 'Laptop B', 'Air Fryer C'],
'brand': ['Brand X', 'Brand Y', 'Brand Z'],
'description': ['A high-end smartphone with advanced features',
'A powerful laptop with long battery life',
'A versatile air fryer for healthy cooking'],
'price': [1000, 1500, 200],
'rating': ['4.5/5', '4.8/5', '4.0/5'],
'competitor': ['Product X, Product Y', 'Product Z, Product W', 'Product V
']
17. })
18.
19. # Define function to generate questions
20. def generate_question(product_name):
21.
return f"What are the features of {product_name}?"
22.
23. # Create list of questions based on product information
24. questions = [generate_question(product_name) for product_name in product_df['
name']]
25.
26. # Generate list of answers from GPT-3.5
27. answers = openai.Completion.create(
28.
engine="text-davinci-002",
29.
prompt=questions,
30.
max_tokens=1024,
31.
n=len(questions),

32.
stop=None,
33.
temperature=0.5
34. )
35.
36. # Extract answers from choices list and convert to dataframe
37. answer_df = pd.DataFrame([answer.choices[0].text.strip() for answer in answer
s], columns=['features'])
38.
39. # Combine product information dataframe with answer dataframe
40. result_df = pd.concat([product_df, answer_df], axis=1)
41.
42. # Print the result
43. print(result_df)

When customers are interested in a specific product, a chatbot will be created to query a list
of questions to gather information about the features of that product. The chatbot will then
call the OpenAI API to answer those questions, and then provide the customer with detailed
features about the product they are interested in.

5.1.3 Technical Support
ChatGPT can also help customers quickly and effectively resolve technical issues. Especially
in cases where customers do not have much technical knowledge, ChatGPT can guide them through
each step to troubleshoot the issue. This not only saves time for customers but also reduces pressure on

For example, an internet service provider can use ChatGPT to support customers in setting up and
configuring modems, resolving network connection or slow access issues.
5.1.4 Order and Payment Process Support
ChatGPT can guide customers through the steps of placing orders and making online payments easily,
from selecting products, filling in delivery information, to confirming and paying for orders. This helps
enhance the shopping experience of customers and increase the conversion rate.
For example, an e-commerce website can deploy ChatGPT to support customers in placing orders,
answering questions about shipping fees, delivery time, and payment methods.
5.1.5 Personalized Interaction and Advice
Based on the personal data of customers, ChatGPT can provide personalized advice and
suggestions, helping to increase the ability to meet individual needs. This benefits both customers and
businesses by increasing customer satisfaction and improving effectiveness in counseling and support.
For example, an insurance company can use ChatGPT to analyze customer data, thereby providing
proposals for suitable insurance packages based on factors such as age, preferences, needs, and health
status.
5.1.6 Conclusion
